<h4>A Student Representative Council (SRC) is a group of students elected by <br>their peers to represent all students within the school</h4>

<h3>Some of the things I will do is :
    <br>
    Clean toilets
    <br>
    Plant trees
    <br>
    Awareness on Nature conversation
    <br>
    Encourage others
